# CLINotes

This is an example project showing how to use Apples ArgumentParser framework. 

Save your notes as files via command-line.

To build and run the executable in your terminal, move to the project directory and run these commands: 

`swift build -c release`

and 

`cp -fÂ .build/release/CLITool /usr/local/bin/CLINotes`
